                    <p></p>The HTT-40 is an Indian basic trainer aircraft developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). It is designed for the initial training of pilots in the Indian Air Force (IAF). The aircraft features a turboprop engine, a glass cockpit, and zero-zero ejection seats, enhancing safety and training efficiency. The HTT-40 replaces the aging HPT-32 Deepak trainers and complements the Swiss Pilatus PC-7 in the IAF.</p>
                <img src="gallery2.jpg"><h2>LCA Tejas (Light Combat Aircraft Tejas)</h2>
                <p>The LCA Tejas is a fourth-generation, single-engine, multi-role fighter aircraft developed by HAL for the Indian Air Force and Navy. It is part of India's Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative for self-reliance in defense. The aircraft features fly-by-wire controls, an advanced AESA radar, beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles, and composite materials for a lightweight structure. Tejas is designed to replace aging MiG-21 fighters in the IAF and has variants such as Tejas Mk1, Mk1A, and the upcoming Tejas Mk2.</p>
                <img src="gallery3.jpg"><h2>LCH (Light Combat Helicopter)</h2>
                <p>The LCH is a twin-engine, multi-role attack helicopter developed by HAL, designed for high-altitude warfare. It is the world’s lightest attack helicopter capable of operating at altitudes over 16,000 feet, making it ideal for mountainous regions like Ladakh and the Siachen Glacier. The LCH is equipped with stealth features, armor protection, night-fighting capabilities, anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), and air-to-air missiles. It is deployed by both the IAF and the Indian Army for counterinsurgency, reconnaissance, and close air support missions.</p>
